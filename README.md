# awesome-msr [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated repository of data sets and tools that can be used for data-driven empirical software engineering, a method also known as _mining software repositories_ (MSR). For examples of such work see the [Mining Software Repositories](http://2016.msrconf.org/#/hall-of-fame) conference.
Many of the data set can also be useful in research using [search-based software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search-based_software_engineering).
